# Timely Transit

Timely Transit uses React, Node, and OC Transpo's public API to allow users to find the next three buses coming to their chosen bus stop.

### This project allowed me to practice core React concepts:

  - Utilizing `useEffect` to deal with React side effects
  - Managing state with `useState`
  - Using asynchronous JavaScript to fetch data from an API with GET and POST requests
  - Handling forms and user input
  - Using JavaScript's `.map()` to create reusable components
  - Composability

### Additionally, I expanded my skill set by working with Node.js (code in TimelyTransitBackend):

  - Configured a `server.js` file to manage API requests and process incoming user data on the backend

### Note: The server may take up to 50 seconds to respond after periods of inactivity due to the free hosting plan.
